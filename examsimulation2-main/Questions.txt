1. When a method is declared 'static'..
[ ] A1.1 - it can access any attribute in the class
[ ] A1.2 - it can access only static attributes
[ ] A1.3 - it must be called using a reference
[ ] A1.4 - it does not require a reference to be called
[ ] A1.5 - it is visible only int the package 


2. What is the purpose of the operator `<>`?
[ ] A2.1 - make a comparison between references 
[ ] A2.2 - exchange values between two variables
[ ] A2.3 - define generic parameters using type inference
[ ] A2.4 - define *method reference*
[ ] A2.5 - define an abstract class


3. An error (as opposed to a failure) in a test JUnit:
[ ] A3.1 - corresponds to a false assertion
[ ] A3.2 - corresponds to an exception thrown by the tested program 
[ ] A3.3 - cannot correspond to a line with an assert
[ ] A3.4 - corresponds to throw in the tested program
[ ] A3.5 - corresponds to method fail()


4. Inheritance between two classes allows
[ ] A4.1 - removing attributes
[ ] A4.2 - adding attributes
[ ] A4.3 - removing methods
[ ] A4.4 - redefining methods
[ ] A4.5 - adding methods
